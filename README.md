## What your program does.
- If the user selects (E), they are prompted to enter a password. The program validates the password based on the following criteria:
   - Minimum length of 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character
- If the user selects (G), the program generates and displays a strong random password.

## How to run your program and any necessary dependencies.
### Prerequisites
- To run the program you need to have python installed
### Running
- In the terminal for windows if you are in the git repo then you would do `python block_proj_2.py` and it will start the program
   - I believe for mac you would need to do `python3 block_proj_2.py`
## Clear warnings about its limitations
- This tool is for educational use only and should not be used for securing sensitive information, since it is unable to store information
- This tool should not be used as a user's only form of having secure passwords
## Ethical considerations and responsible use. In writing this, make sure to consider how your tool might be misused
- Users should supplement this tool with other secure services such as a trusted password manager
- Anyone who decides to use this in their code should make sure to follow security best practices, such as implementing password hashing and secure storage methods.
- The program should be used only in safe and ethical environments, such as educational settings or personal testing.
- Users should not rely only on this because a password can meet all the requirements and still be easily brute forced by a hacker (e.g. Password123).
